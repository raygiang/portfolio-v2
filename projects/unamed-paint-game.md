This was a game built for Global Game Jam 2020. The idea for this game was inspired by Splatoon, a team-based shooter where the goal is to have your team control most of the terrain on the map.

This is an HTML5 game built using Phaser. It uses Socket.io for multiplayer functionality, and is written in TypeScript.
