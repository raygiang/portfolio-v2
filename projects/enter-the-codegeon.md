This was an application built as part of a team for a school project. The idea was to build a game that introduced children to the logical thinking required for programming. Feel free to login and try the app with the following credentials. Username: test, Password: test

I was responsible for implementing the game functionality and the stage builder. The stage builder lets any logged in user create a stage that others can play on. Uses a recursive algorithm to check if the stage being created has a solution.
