This is a browser game built with two of my classmates for Global Game Jam 2019. It is a tower defense game where the player defends their home from invaders. I was responsible for the game logic.

The entire game was built on an HTML5 Canvas using vanilla JavaScript. The game has features including different types of towers, upgradable and sellable towers, and the invaders have a chance to drop power-ups!
