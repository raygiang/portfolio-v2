My old portfolio website!

This website was built using React, MongoDB is used to store the information for my projects, and Express is used to communicate between the two. The bubbles on the splash page are React components, they can be popped by clicking on them or moving the mouse through them. The fish on the about page is animated using an HTML Canvas, itâ€™s eye will follow the position of your mouse. The loading animation was created using CSS keyframe animations.
