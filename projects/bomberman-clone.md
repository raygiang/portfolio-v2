This was a clone of a Bomberman that I built while learning how to use Cocos Creator. Blocks can be destroyed and have a random chance of dropping power-ups.

This game was built using Cocos Creator, a game editor that allows you to build cross platform games using only JavaScript. The code for this game was written in TypeScript.
