My Piano was created for an assignment that focused on CSS animations. The piano can be played using mouse or keyboard. There is also a challenge where you must hit the keys at the correct time, or you can play a demo which shows you how the challenge should sound.

The animations were created using CSS keyframe animations and the game logic was programmed using JavaScript and JQuery.
