This game was a personal project of mine. The game pits four players against each other. Each player is trying to paint the canvas with the most of their own colour before time runs out.

The game is based in an HTML5 Canvas and uses Socket.io for the multiplayer aspect. I created the sprite sheets and backgrounds for this game using Piskel.
