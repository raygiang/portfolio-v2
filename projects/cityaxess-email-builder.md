This Email Builder was created for Hack the Curve 2020. Its intended purpose was to serve as a mass communication tool for municipalities. The idea was that local authorities could report emergencies to the municipal government through this app, and an easily customizable email can be created and sent out once approved. It is still in the development stage.

This application uses the headless CMS, Strapi in the backend. React is used in the front end to create a drag and drop email builder for creating customizable HTML emails.
